# MaNDala

The MaNGA Dwarf galaxy (MaNDala) Sample is a sample of dwarf galaxies observed with Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) by MaNGA (Bundy et al. 2015), which is one of the main SDSS IV projects (Blanton et al., 2017).
The sample is defined to contain galaxies with stellar masses < 10^9.06 MSun (stellar masses are taken from the NSA catalogue using h=0.7), and to be less bright than the Large Magalleanic Cloud (i.e. M < 18.5).

The MaNDala sample is described in Cano-Díaz, et al., 2022., and further information about the project may be found in our website: https://mandalasample.wordpress.com. The results from our analyses done to the spectroscpic MaNGA data and to photometric public data provided by the Dark Energy Instrument (DESI, Dey, et al., 2019) are public and provided as a SDSS IV Added Value Catalogue which can be retrieved in the following webpage: https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr17/manga/mandala. Documentation about the Catalogue can be read in Cano-Díaz et al., 2022 and in here: https://data.sdss.org/datamodel/files/MANGA_MANDALA.

The Mandala_v10_DepthLimits.txt table given here contains the 5_sigma depth limits for the g, r, z DESI photometric bands for each individual galaxy in the MaNDala V_1_0 sample. For futher detail about them please refer to Cano-Díaz, et al., 2022 (see Sections 4 and 5). If you wish to use the results given in this table for your own research please cite this paper.
